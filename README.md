This is all about our product HouseCom™ ThermoSecure™ System. We will show you all about our product, the many different ways it is interactive with your smart watch, iPhone or Android, tablet and desktop computer. Not to mention the wall unit itself. 

We've included GUI views of ThermoSecure on an iWatch, Macbook Air, iPad, Desktop and wall unit so users are able to see the different looks on each screen size.

The product HouseCom™ ThermoSecure™ System is a smart thermostat that has the ability to be controlled from just about anywhere; iOs and Android, the wall unit, and the app as well as desktop. It's 100% digital, can be both hardwired as well as wireless (WiFi, Bluetooth) enabled home personal and secure environment control system. You have access from home or away to access the home security system; allowing you to check how many people/animals are in the house with the portable remote cameras. It also gives you acces to checking the smoke and carbon monoxide status and independent room temperatures. You can also get the house ready for your return by unlocking doors and opening windows.

All of this functionality and more are part of the capabilities of the HouseCom™
ThermoSecure™ System and environment system.
